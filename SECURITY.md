## Exclusion
Samples use outdated version (netcore 2.1) by design which have security issues and are no longer maintained. 
This is NOT a security issue as no code of the samples is used in the library. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability please send a mail to support@dbosoft.eu or open a ticket on https://support.dbosoft.eu.

We will take your security reports serious and review it as soon as possible.
